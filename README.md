# Random-Dynamical-Systems-UROP
This GitHub page contains code written for investigations into stationary and quasi-stationary measures of random dynamical systems. This research was part of a 2nd year UROP project 
conducted at Imperial College London under supervision of PhD student Matheus Manzatto de Castro. 

The code has been uploaded in a single ipython notebook file (python3), which includes multiple functions used throughout the project. 

This code can be used to approximate stationary distributions for 1d and 2d maps, quasi-stationary distributions for 1d maps with escape, and for computing top and conditional Lyapunov exponents.
